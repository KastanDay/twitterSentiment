# userAnalysis

Dependencies:
  1. pip install tweepy
  
      www.tweepy.org - to fetch info from Twitter API
  2. pip install textblob
  
    https://textblob.readthedocs.io/en/dev - to conduct sentiment analysis

To use userAnalysis.py, pass in only one command line argument: the twitter handle you with to examine (capitalization doesn't matter).

Ex:

$ python userAnalysis.py RealDonaldTrump 

If you analize an account with many followers, sentiment analysis will take longer. Fetching tweets from Twitter takes time, and an internet connection.
